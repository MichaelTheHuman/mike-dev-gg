## Software Architect
I enjoy building things, but more importantly, I enjoy designing solutions!
## My work
All of my professional work is private intellectual proprty so I cannot show examples of my code. 
This is why I decided to create this repo, where I can implement some interesting ideas I had, outside of my job requirements. 

### Artist Tracker
One recent idea that popped in my mind was an ability to setup an artist tracker. An app, where you can provide a list of keywords and it'd let you know when the next event in your area is going to be. 

Luckily this was made possible by the Ticketmaster API! I tried multiple other APIs, but this one is best in terms of events available and the free quota of requests.

In the current state, you can select from the defined list of artists (put there by me, but we could easily extend the list or enable user input) and the app will return the events in UK. Very cool! 

There are a lot of improvements to be made and further plans, but you can already see a working solution and an example of my code. 

To see the code specific to the ArtistTracker, navigate here:

## Considerations
This is meant to be viewed on desktop only. Mobile version could be implemented if needed, however currently this is a desktop first application.
